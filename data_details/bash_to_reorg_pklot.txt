I used the following scripts to reorganize the original PKLot database:

To find all the files in the cd of a certain kind and delete them:
(robust against too many arguments)
find . -name "*#*" -type f -delete

To recursively find and rename all the files in folders with a certain name:
occupied_dirs=($(find . -type d -name "Occupied"))
for (( i=0; i<${#occupied_dirs[@]}; i++ ))
do
	(cd ${occupied_dirs[i]} && for file in *.jpg 
		do mv "$file" "${file%.jpg}_o.jpg"
        done)
done


To recursively find and extract all folders of a certain kind to the top level:
declare -a arr=("solum" "primis" "secondus")
for d in "${arr[@]}"
do
	find ./"$d" -type f | xargs -I '{}' mv {} ../data/"$d"/
done
