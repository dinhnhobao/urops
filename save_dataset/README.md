Refer to `../label_examples/README.md` to understand how to generate data in
a form compatible with `serialize_dataset.ipynb`.

Briefly, note that data must be saved in `../data/`, with:

1. Labels in `../data/labels/`.
2. (Cropped) pictures in `../data/cropped/`.
3. `../data/hdf5/` created to store the serialized datasets.
