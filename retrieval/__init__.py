"""The package retrieval has been created to parse the reorganized PKLot
dataset, and create Lot objects that contain the data necessary to train and
test the ML algorithms found in ../ml_algorithms/

(14/01/18)
Currently, methods to parse data have been implemented. Methods to retrieve
data from these Lot objects is to be implemented when it is known exactly
what data is needed for these training and testing purposes.
