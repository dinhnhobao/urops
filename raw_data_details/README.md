# Concerning the data.
The link to the dataset (PKLot) used for training and testing is
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ldpq239OJwdsQnAWFyIw5BlD0ZN__LxW). This
dataset has been reorganized to suit the needs of this project. Note that the
parking lots have been renamed:

## Original --> New
----------------
PUCPR --> solum,
UFPR04 --> primis,
UFPR05 --> secondus
 
 
## Update (14/01/18)
_________________
Major updates have been further made to the data due to inconsistencies with the 
original data's xml annotation. Please take a look at this newest organization of 
PKLot to understand the motivations behind the package `retrieval`, to be uploaded
soon.
